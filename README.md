# Environment Setup for ROS Projects

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to guiding users through the setup process for environments tailored to Robotics Operating System (ROS) projects, focusing on Linux, Git, and ROS.

## Project Goals

The goal is to enable users to perform fundamental operations using the Ubuntu command line, manage Git repositories effectively, and develop elementary ROS nodes in Python.

### Learning Outcomes
- Operate within Ubuntu's command line to create directories and files.
- Utilize Git for repository management and version control.
- Develop and understand basic ROS nodes in Python.

### Key ROS Concepts
- An overview of ROS core systems, including packaging, build systems, messaging, and command-line and graphical user interface tools.
- The process of creating ROS packages, nodes, topics, services, and parameters.
- Steps to develop and analyze a simple Publisher and Subscriber in Python.
- Guidance on creating a simple Service and Client in Python and their examination.
